          <h2>History Of Temple</h2>
          <p>
            Kankhal is also a famous place at a distance of one mile near Haridwar, the famous pilgrimage of Hindus, where apart from travelers, there is also a permanent settlement in which almost all castes reside. Jains keep coming here from every corner of India, till now (in Haridwar and Kankhal) almost everyone's Dharamshalas have been built, but there was no place for Jaijis so that the brothers coming from outside needed it and the people here Resident Jain brothers also understood its necessity very much because they too did not have any temple here to perform their religious rituals. Realizing this need, in the year 1922 Mrs. Kampadevi, the wife of Meerut resident late La. Badridas ji Rais (who has a lot of property here) pledged to build a Jain temple at her own cost, but at that time due to some reason she did not get permission from the municipality. Could go and the work was postponed.
<br>
After this, on 6-4-31 Shriman Brahmachari Sheetprasad ji arrived and by his advice, the Jain brothers of Kankhal decided that there must be a Chaityalaya here, because without it we cannot follow our religion and people coming from outside Brothers also suffer. Rs.3000/- estimated expenditure was imposed for the construction of Chaityalaya and the following gentlemen gave immediate help-
La0 Boolchand Bajaj 100/-
La0 Bahal Singh Bannilal 100/-
La0 Sunhar Lal Peshkar 100/-
La0 Kashmiri Lal 100/-
La0 Pyare Lal 50/-
La0 Surajmal 50/-
La0 Samandar Lal 2/-
<br>
To start the construction work of the temple, Sunhari Lal ji was given the post of manager and treasurer and he was also given the right to deposit this money in the post office and start the work only when it is deposited enough to start the work. Give and by appointing Ramsharan Das as a campaigner, he was empowered to receive donations from outside and send them to the manager. Accordingly, donations were received from here and there through appeals which was around 900/- but it was difficult to get even a piece of land let alone the construction of Chaityalaya with such a small amount, and therefore the brothers here decided to give that money to the donors. May be returned with interest or given wherever the donor asks. Accordingly the donors were informed but no definite property was found. In such a hopeless situation a piece of land was accidentally found which was bought for Rs.800/-. But the construction work could not start due to devotion.
<br>
161/- was received at the same time. After this, the construction work of the temple was started. Except Rs.251/- of Mrs. Mishri Bai, all the donors have completed their two sentences but Shrimji ji did not complete his sentence even after repeated reminders by the Panchayat.
<br>
In Bhadrapada month of 1937, two brothers went to Dehradun, Saharanpur, Bijnor and Meerut etc. by deputation, deputation received help from all places except Dehradun and Dhampur. Some prominent people in Dehradun had promised to collect and send donations on Chatudashi but still did not send. The members of Dehradun who came to Jwalapur Vedi Pratishtha definitely received their donations, which is written in the list of donors written ahead. But in Dhampur, the deputation was treated very rudely, while the deputation was called again in the winter to collect donations, accordingly two brothers from Kankhal went to collect donations, after staying for two days, Sahu Chandiprasad ji came, to about Rs.40/-Funds were collected, but as soon as the receipt for that donation was given, they found some mistake in the receipt book and said bad things to the members of the deputation and neither gave the collected donation nor sent it to us here, don't know what happened to that donation. It is our request to Shahu Saheb that if he has any apprehension, then remove it and at that time also he should have done the same, but should not have insulted the brothers in this way. Later we came to know that he sent a letter from Jwalapur resident La Murarilal ji and also came to know something, but the collected donations still did not come to us.
<br>
At this time, leaving the entrance of Dharamshala, the rest of the lower part is almost ready, in which Mr. Ulfalrai ji Engineer Saharanpur (present day Meerut) got a room built in the memory of late wife Mrs. Putlibai and in this room the altar was established by Mrs. Gomti Kunwar Rais. It will be from Saharanpur side, and the second room upstairs has been built by Kankhal resident Smt. Gullakandi Bai, wife of Late Lt. A room downstairs in Dharamshala was built by Ambaprasad ji Rais and Honorary Magistrate Meerut Sadar resident.
<br>
As of now, plaster and pair of doors, road to the temple through Sadar Darwaza and balcony and living is a very important work, without which everything is incomplete, 3000 rupees are needed to complete this work. Therefore, all the gentlemen are requested to become a part of religion by completing this holy work and whoever wants to build a whole room, you can come or send money to get it done, on which a stone will be put in their name. All the details of income and expenditure are given further. While completing all this, we are grateful to Mr. Murarilal Baburam, resident of Jwalapur, who made the deputation successful by giving his invaluable time and hope that he will help in the same way in the future. Will remain Mr. La. Jethmal, resident of Kankhal, La. Chhotanlal,
