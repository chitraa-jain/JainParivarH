          <h2>History Of Temple</h2>
          <p>
            Haridwar - The place where the degenerate Pavani Ganga touches the earth for the first time after coming out from its origin place snow-capped Gomukh, after completing a zigzag mountain journey of about 300 kilometers, the same place is world famous as 'Haridwar'. This picturesque city, situated on the western bank of the Mother Ganga, between the Neel and Bilva mountains, is one of the seven most sacred Mokshadayini cities of India. This Navtirtha, Chintamani Parshvanath Jain Shvetambara Tirtha

, is scattered like a divine constellation in the bright sky of such a holy city Haridwar , to which the entire Jain society has faith and loyalty. Every particle of this pilgrimage is holy for the faithful Jains.
<br>
The first Tirkkar Bhagwan Adinath (Rishabhdev) had distributed his kingdom to his hundred sons before initiation. The main kingdom of Vinita (Ayodhya) was given to his son Bharakshaj. Till eternity, the Maharajas of this place have been becoming entitled to the supreme position by leading a pious life. This city has been a major pilgrimage center for Hindus for more than five thousand years. For this reason, the government has completely prohibited the consumption of alcohol and meat in Haridwar.
<br>
According to Jain scriptures, the first Tirthankar Lord Rishabhdev attained Nirvana on the Ashtapad mountain. At present Ashtapada is unknown but it must be possible to be somewhere near Mount Kailash in the Himalayan ranges. When Prabhu Adinath would have reached Ashtapada at the time of Nirvana, his holy feet must have been lying on the holy land of Haridwar.
According to the lotus feet of Lord Adinath installed on the Rayan pagle on the Shatrunjan Tirtha and the lotus feet of the same size are installed on the right side of Shri Chintamani Parshwanath Jain Shvetambara Temple with the right and Rayan direction. The prestige and establishment of these lotus feet took place in December 1997 in the holy Nishra of Pujya Acharya Dev Padamsagar Suri Ji Masa.
On the auspicious day of Akshaya Tritiya, the ascetics of Varshitap are blessed by serving and worshiping the lotus feet of the Lord, performing Parana to Ikshuras in Hastinapur and visiting this pilgrimage the next day.
<br>
History of pilgrimage establishment-There was neither any Jain Dharamshala/Upashraya nor any Shvetambara Jain temple on this holy pilgrimage land of Haridwar, which is adorned with most Dharamshalas across India. Late Lala Sundarlal ji Jain of Motilal Banarsidas Prakashan Sansthan always used to suffer from this deficiency. Lala ji had discussed this on many occasions with Seth Kasturbhai Lalbhai, the president of Seth Anandji Kalyanji Pedhi. He also had the same feeling that a grand Jain temple as well as a Dharamshala, Upashraya and Bhojanshala should be built on this holy land. But this dream of his could not come true during the lifetime of both those great personalities.
<br>
Padashree late Shantilal Jain, nephew of Lala Sundarlal ji, had inherited the spirit of building a Jain temple in Haridwar. He expressed his sacred sentiments in front of Chennai's sushravak, exclusive Navkarbhakta late Mr. Morilalji Nahar. Inspired by the inspiration and auspicious blessings of Param Pujya Acharya Shri Kalapurnasuriji M.S. and Pujya Muniraj Shri Jambuvijayji M.S. Late Shri Amarchandji Vaid, a resident of Chennai, who had divine blessings of his late father, also became an important link in this project and the dream of building the temple began to come true.
For the original plan, first of all the land was selected and purchased by Lala Shantilal ji with the help of his friend and present president of Mandir Nyay, Padashree Shri Gyanchand ji Jain. “A good beginning is considered half the work done in itself.” Today the pilgrimage complex is spread over a total of one lakh square feet of land and the process of expansion is on.</p>
        <br>
        Craft of the temple - This grand artistic Jin temple of Shri Chintamani Parshvanath built in golden yellow stone of Jaisalmer is unique and unique in itself. According to Jain Shilpa Shastra, the design of this temple was done under the skillful coordination of Shri Virendra Bhai, the grandson of Shri Amritbhai Trivedi, the famous Sompura of India. Even after eight years of the establishment of the temple, the work of decorating the form and carving of this temple is going on continuously. In which the artistry of the temple will continue to shine even more.
<br>
Shree Chintamani Parshvanath Jin Prasad, the twenty-third Tirthankar Shree Parshvanath Bhagwan, built in the form of the black-skinned Poshan, sits in the form of original leader in the sanctum sanctorum of the upper floor of the grand, Sapirkar Pratimaji temple. The 16th Tirthankar Shri Shantinath Bhagwan and the 22nd Tirthankar Shri Neminath Bhagwan are also enshrined in the theater on the upper floor. In the Kauli Mandap outside the sanctum sanctorum of the deity, Sri Parshvayaksha and the presiding deity Padmavati Yakshini are enshrined.
<br>

In the ground floor of the temple, a 51” white-coloured statue of the first Tirthankar Shri Rishabhdev Bhagwan is installed in the sanctum sanctorum, as well as in the Rangamandap, the statues of Virahman Tirthankar Shri Simandhar Swami ji and the last Tirthankar Shri Mahavir Swami ji are seated. The idols of Shri Gautam Swami, the first Ganadhar of Adinath Prabhu, Pundrik Wami and Mahavir Swamiji's first Ganadhar, are established in the Rangamandap itself. In the Rangamandap itself, the grand statue of Moolanayak Adinath Bhagwan, who was established in Badrinath, is also present as a guest.
<br>
The auspicious consecration of this pilgrimage was accomplished on the auspicious day of Magh Shukla Shashti, February 5, 1995 in the auspicious nishra of Acharya Padmsagar Surishwar ji and Acharya Vijay Dharmadhurandhar Suri ji.
<br>
The idols of Shri Manibhadra Dev and Kshetrapal ji are temporarily established and soon those idols will be reinstated by making artistic Dehri.
 <br>
 Sages and saints from all sects of Jainism keep coming to Upashraya Shri Chintamani Parshvanath Tirtha throughout the year. Those saints and sages, saints and Mahatmas who travel towards Rishikesh, Dehradun, Badrinath, they definitely take a break at this pilgrimage according to their compatibility. This land has also become sacred by the touch of the feet of many Jaineter Mahatmas. This pilgrimage also got the benefit of the last Chaturmas of Gachchadhipati Vijay Indra Dinn Surishwar ji of Atma Vallabh tradition.
<br> A beautiful and well-equipped shelter has been constructed in the pilgrimage area for worship and worship of saints and saints.
<br> Navkar Aradhana Mandir is a plan to construct a Navakar Aradhana Mandir for meditation and worship of Mahamantra Navakar in the shrine which will be built in the near future according to the concepts of Navakar worshiper Pujya Shorilal ji.
<br>
At present, Navakar Aradhana Mandir is established in the auditorium located on the ground floor of Upashraya Bhavan, where Navakar Aradhana is performed. Pilgrims worship Navkar here and purify their body and mind. All the employees of the pilgrimage site offer their prayers here every morning, in which the travelers staying in the pilgrimage site also take their prayers.
<br>
Rajkumar Mangatram Guest House This guest house built for comfortable accommodation of pilgrims was inaugurated in 1993. Attached to the shelter, this guest house has rooms and halls for the accommodation of about 200 passengers. On the ground floor of this guest house, the Bhojanshala and Aymbil Khata are located.
<br>
Religious devotion For the purpose of organizing religious devotion, all the arrangements for the residence and food of the pilgrims visiting the pilgrimage area have been made free of cost. There is a beautiful arrangement for the food arrangements of the pilgrims in the restaurant and the Ayambil account itself. In which allowance has been arranged for both the meals, breakfast, tea and for the passengers coming after the dining hours. Permanent (permanent) dates have been kept for dinner, breakfast and both the meals. The expenses of the mess run only from the interest earned on them. Dates are currently being booked with the following amounts -
<br>
Breakfast - Rs 3100 <br>
Lunch - Rs 7100 <br>
Evening Meal - Rs 7100 <br>
Allowance - Rs 3100 <br>
Pilgrimage Management Two trusts have been constituted for the management of the pilgrimage. Vishwa Kalyan Atma Jain Foundation has been formed for the construction and arrangement of the temple and for the management of Devdravya in the Chitamani Parshvanath Jain Temple, Justice and Bhojanshala, Dharamshala, Upashraya. In both the above trusts, experienced, service minded, charitable noble trustees from different regions of India are invited. At present, trustees from Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Rajasthan, Delhi, Punjab, Uttaranchal etc. areas are working in these trusts and they are dedicated with body, mind and wealth for the development of this pilgrimage.
<br> Future plans For the development of the pilgrimage, plans are proposed for the construction of Pedi block and employee housing in the future. Their construction is possible only with the help of the public and donations from charitable persons are very important for these constructions. <br>
