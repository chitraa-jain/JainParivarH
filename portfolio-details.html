          <h2>History Of Temple</h2>
          <p>
            Shri Adinathaya Namah
<br>
Sarvasukh In the history of the whole world, the country named Bharatvarsha is famous for its unique shade. In this country of India, Dev Bhoomi Uttaranchal state which was formed on 09.11.2000 from the northern part of Uttar Pradesh state, is now known as Dev Bhoomi Uttarakhand from 01.01.2007. In which Haridwar Nagar is a world famous city, which is the gateway to the journey of Char Dham, its identity in the chain of pilgrimages. According to the Jains, this Haridwar pilgrimage area is known as the wandering place of the first Tirthankar Lord Rishabhdev ji and Mount Kailash as the place of Nirvana.
<br>
In this auspicious Haridwar pilgrimage city, for the first time in the history of thousands of years, a Digambara monk Shri 108 Shri “Vidyanand” Ji Maharaj entered the Char Dham on the auspicious date of May 23, 1969, for the purpose of the main Shri “Badrinath” Dham Yatra. Stayed for day stay. Whose history is the witness that social classes of all castes along with the most revered Mahant and Saints of all religions had given an unprecedented welcome with full of heart and happy heart, which became forever memorable for the city of Haridwar.
<br>
At that time, there was no Jain temple for Darshan here and there was no Jain place cultured according to Jain method, for sadhus and scholars and special visitors, due to which many difficulties remained on the arrival of that sadhu.
<br>
The said Digambara sage Muni-Maharaj made this resolution while stopping at other places, examining the devoted religious spirit in the families of the Jain followers here. A Jain temple and Jain place should be established here for hospitality. With such thoughts and thoughts, Digambar Muni Shri left for Badrinath Yatra and while returning, Muni Shri spent his Chatumas stay at a place near Srinagar Garhwal Jain Temple. Digambar Muni 108 Shri 'Vidyanand' Ji Maharaj returned to Haridwar pilgrimage in December 1969 after completing Chartumas. Arrangements were made with local cooperation at Haridwar Tirtha located at Shri Geeta Bhavan (Punjab Mahavir Dal). Munishree gave discourses everyday during his 30 days continuous stay. Meanwhile, in front of Munishree Shriyut Lala Rajkrishna ji Jain Daryaganj, Delhi came to Haridwar and placed its wish in front of Muni ji to get the temple constructed. Muni Shri blessed with a happy heart. Lala Rajkrishna ji Jain returned to Delhi with his son after taking the blessings of Munishree and told his beloved son Premchand ji Jain about his intention to build a Jain temple and a Jain place in Hirdwar soon and ordered that the work be completed.
<br>
During this long stay of Muni Shri, consultations continued in many ways and a committee was also formed at the local forum and some promise and cash amount was also deposited in the bank for the construction of the temple.
<br>
In the name of Shree Rajkrishna Jain Trust Delhi, Mr. Premchand Ji Jain's son Late Shri Rajkrishna Ji Jain, Daryaganj, Delhi united day and night in the effort of building the temple keeping his father's wish in mind. Through untiring efforts, it was decided to take land from Uttar Pradesh government for Jain temple and equivalent Jain rest house, free dispensary, library etc. on Laltarau bridge located in Haridwar city. After making efforts, the Uttar Pradesh government got the place for the temple and the proposal for other construction works was pending.
<br>
Shri Premchand Jain continued to work even when he was alone and with the blessings of Muni Shri, he continued to succeed despite many obstacles. Shri Premchand ji continued to get local support, in his works the first Jain temple was given the form of non-violence temple. By trying in this series, Mr. Premchand ji Jain laid the foundation stone for the construction of Ahimsa Mandir on August 17, 1980 by His Excellency the then Governor of Punjab State Mr. “Jaisukhlal Hathi” and with the help of His Excellency the Governor, received an amount of five thousand rupees from the Punjab Government for the temple. Took. Lala Premchand ji Jain showed full enthusiasm in the construction and got full cooperation from the representatives of the local society. After the construction of a big hall and some rooms, the statue of Lord Neminath, the twenty-second Tirthankar of Jainism, was enshrined in one room in the year 1980. Since then, daily Prakshal-worship and festivals continued to be organized, slowly the construction work also went on.
<br>
The statue of Lord Neminath has been so important that this place itself has become a very important area, the construction of the remaining part of the temple has started, the Shikhar has been built, the formation of the committee at the local level continues. The committee maintained contact with the trust of Delhi. Lala Premchand ji Jain used to come and go continuously. After the completion of the construction of the main part of the temple, such a happy occasion came that some time ago, the very ancient and grand statue of the first Tirthankar Bhagwan 'Adinath', which came to the notice of Muni 108 Shri 'Vidyanand Ji' Maharaj, which is located in the Archaeological Museum of the Government of India. Received from the Dept. That grand statue was received by the Archaeological Department from excavation in Guna city of Madhya Pradesh, which at that time was established in Ahimsa Mandir Daryaganj, Delhi.
<br>
The said statue was established from Ahimsa Mandir Delhi to Ahimsa Mandir Haridwar by sitting in Laltarau bridge.
<br>
Lala Premchand ji consecrated the altar of the main altar and handed over the arrangements to Haridwar. The body elections of the committees at the local stage are held from time to time.
